# maxscript2Github


A little tool for commit and push your repository directly from 3dsMax using Maxscript and command line

At this moment i have used ShellLaunch "cmd" for command  line and it open every time a new cmd window. I need to figure out another way like "Doscommand" but for now i have problems with paths.
